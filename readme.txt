# MICRO INFLUENCER AND REFERRAL MARKETING FOR E-COMMERCE.

Make it easy for your most satisfied customers to share their love for your business with their friends, and reward them for doing so.

Redeal is a referral marketing tool that lets you reward your most loyal customers for recommending your business to their friends, helping you drive more sales, acquire new customers and improve customer loyalty at the same time.

Customers trust word-of-mouth recommendations over any other channel (as a matter of fact it influences more than 80% of online buying decisions). Most of your customers are satisfied, but unless they get an easy way to do so, only a handful of them will recommend your business to your friends. This is where Redeal can help out!
